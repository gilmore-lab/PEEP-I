# Proximal Emotional Environment Project (PEEP-I)

This repository contains files and R code related to the PEEP-I project. Specifically, it contains behavioral ratings from n=39 children who were asked to rate the level of anger or happiness in a series of recordings featuring an adult speaker. The recordings were designed to simulate angry, happy, and neutral prosodies.

The recordings used in this study can be found on [Databrary](http://databrary.org/volume/248).

The ratings data can be found in [analysis/csv/peep-I-ratings.csv].

Files that produce simple plots of the rating distributions can be found in [RMarkdown](ratings-analysis.Rmd) and [HTML](https://rawgit.com/gilmore-lab/PEEP-I/master/ratings-analysis.html) formats.
